## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- [Vue.js](https://v3.vuejs.org/) - JS Framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Tailwind CSS

### What I learned

My frontend skils were never the best. SO, I've decided to take on these challenges to hone my frontend skills.
I've used vue with tailwind before and I love the combo. So, I used them in this project, though they ight be a little overkill. 
I used flexbox a lot for this component. Also, really happy to pull off the image hover effect. I wanted to do something like this for a while. Took full advantyage of the tailwind theme system which made my workflow way smoother.


### Continued development

I'd definitely like to learn more about positioning, insets etc. Definitely gonna implement these a lot more in my future projects
